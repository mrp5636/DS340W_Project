# DS340W_Project

The tweetnlp-main folder contains the original code from the parent paper.

The Project folder contains the first implementation of the parent paper as Implementation.ipynb as well as the modified implementation as ModifiedImplementation.ipynb. 

The Data folder contains all of the datasets used in this project. It includes the raw datasets as well as the processed labeled datasets that resulted from my research. 

My written report of my work is Analyzing-The-Effects-Of-Covid19-On-Mental-Health-Through-Tweets.doc.
