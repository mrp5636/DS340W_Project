# DS340W_Project

The tweetnlp-main folder contains the original code and data downloaded directly from the first parent paper.

The Project folder contains the first implementation of the parent paper on my chosen platform as ImplementationPlatform.ipynb as well as the modified implementation as ModifiedImplementationPlatform.ipynb. This folder also contains all of the datasets used in this project, including the raw datasets and the processed labeled datasets that resulted from my analysis. 

A written report of my work is Analyzing-The-Effects-Of-Covid19-On-Mental-Health-Through-Tweets.pdf.
