    "@PolitiBunny @CTULocal1 Political leverage, science said schools could reopen, teachers and unions protested to keep'em closed and made demands for higher wages and benefits, they're usin Covid as a crutch at the expense of life and education.",
    "Congratulations to all the exporters on achieving record exports in Dec 2020 with a growth of 18 % over the previous year. Well done &amp; keep up this trend. A major pillar of our govt's economic policy is export enhancement &amp; we will provide full support to promote export culture.",
    "@ImranKhanPTI Pakistan seems a worst country in term of exporting facilities. I am a small business man and if I have to export a t-shirt having worth of $5 to USA or Europe. Postal cost will be around $30. How can we grow as an exporting country if this situation prevails. Think about it. #PM",
    "The thing that doesn’t sit right with me about “nothing good happened in 2020” is that it ignores the largest protest movement in our history. The beautiful, powerful Black Lives Matter uprising reached every corner of the country and should be central to our look back at 2020.",

If @realDonaldTrump didn’t approve of what @LLinWood is doing he would have let us know a lonnnnnng time ago. I’ve always wondered why Lin’s Twitter handle started with “LLin” https://t.co/0G7zClOmi2",

    "The mask cult can’t ever admit masks don’t work because their ideology is based on feeling like a “good person”  Wearing a mask makes them a “good person” &amp; anyone who disagrees w/them isn’t  They can’t tolerate any idea that makes them feel like their self-importance is unearned",
    "@ianmSC Beyond that, they put such huge confidence in masks so early with no strong evidence that they have any meaningful benefit, they don’t want to backtrack or admit they were wrong. They put the cart before the horse, now desperate to find any results that match their hypothesis.",
